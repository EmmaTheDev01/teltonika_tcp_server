```

### **Step 4: Configure Ports**
- [ ] Set port to `5000` in Render settings
- [ ] Set health check path to `http://localhost:8080/`
- [ ] Click "Create Web Service"

## üîß **Teltonika Device Configuration**

### **Step 1: Access Device Configuration**
- [ ] Open Teltonika Configurator
- [ ] Connect to your GPS device
- [ ] Navigate to "Server" settings

### **Step 2: Configure Server Settings**
- [ ] **Server IP:** `your-tcp-server.onrender.com`
- [ ] **Port:** `5000`
- [ ] **Protocol:** `TCP`
- [ ] **Data Sending Interval:** `30 seconds`
- [ ] **Data Sending on Event:** `Enabled`
- [ ] **Data Sending on Ignition:** `Enabled`

### **Step 3: Save Configuration**
- [ ] Click "Save" to save configuration
- [ ] Click "Reboot" to apply changes
- [ ] Device will restart and begin sending data

## üß™ **Testing Checklist**

### **Step 1: Test Health Check**
- [ ] Service is deployed and running
- [ ] Health check responds: `curl https://your-server.onrender.com:8080/`
- [ ] Response shows "healthy" status
- [ ] Statistics show 0 packets initially

### **Step 2: Test TCP Connection**
- [ ] Test with telnet: `telnet your-server.onrender.com 5000`
- [ ] Connection is established
- [ ] No immediate disconnection

### **Step 3: Test with Simulated Device**
- [ ] Run test script: `npm test`
- [ ] All test scenarios pass
- [ ] Server logs show test connections
- [ ] Health check shows test packets

### **Step 4: Test Real Device**
- [ ] Device connects to server
- [ ] Server logs show device connection
- [ ] GPS data is received and parsed
- [ ] Data is forwarded to web app
- [ ] Health check shows real packets

## üìä **Monitoring Checklist**

### **Step 1: Check Logs**
- [ ] View logs in Render dashboard
- [ ] Look for successful startup messages
- [ ] Monitor for device connections
- [ ] Check for packet processing logs
- [ ] Verify API forwarding success

### **Step 2: Monitor Statistics**
- [ ] Health check shows active connections
- [ ] Packet processing statistics are updating
- [ ] Success rate is above 95%
- [ ] No excessive error rates

### **Step 3: Verify Web App Integration**
- [ ] GPS data reaches your web app
- [ ] Database records are created
- [ ] Alerts are generated (if applicable)
- [ ] Real-time tracking is working

## üîç **Troubleshooting Checklist**

### **If Service Won't Start**
- [ ] Check build logs for errors
- [ ] Verify package.json dependencies
- [ ] Check environment variables
- [ ] Ensure port 5000 is available

### **If No Device Connections**
- [ ] Verify device configuration
- [ ] Check network connectivity
- [ ] Test with telnet
- [ ] Review server logs

### **If Data Not Reaching Web App**
- [ ] Check WEB_APP_API_URL configuration
- [ ] Verify web app API endpoint
- [ ] Review API logs
- [ ] Test API endpoint manually

### **If High Packet Failure Rate**
- [ ] Check web app availability
- [ ] Review API timeout settings
- [ ] Monitor web app performance
- [ ] Check network connectivity

## üìà **Performance Optimization**

### **Monitor These Metrics**
- [ ] Connection count (should be stable)
- [ ] Packet processing rate (should be consistent)
- [ ] API response times (should be under 5 seconds)
- [ ] Error rates (should be under 5%)
- [ ] Success rate (should be above 95%)

### **Scaling Considerations**
- [ ] Monitor connection limits
- [ ] Consider upgrading to Standard plan if needed
- [ ] Set up custom domain for better reliability
- [ ] Implement rate limiting if necessary

## üîê **Security Checklist**

### **Basic Security**
- [ ] Use HTTPS for API communication
- [ ] Monitor for suspicious connections
- [ ] Keep dependencies updated
- [ ] Review logs for unusual activity

### **Advanced Security (Optional)**
- [ ] Implement device authentication
- [ ] Add rate limiting
- [ ] Set up firewall rules
- [ ] Configure SSL/TLS certificates

## ‚úÖ **Final Verification**

### **Complete System Test**
- [ ] Multiple devices can connect simultaneously
- [ ] GPS data flows in real-time
- [ ] Web app receives and processes data
- [ ] Database stores location records
- [ ] Alerts are generated correctly
- [ ] Health monitoring is working
- [ ] Statistics are accurate

### **Documentation**
